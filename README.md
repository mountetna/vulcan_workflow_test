# vulcan_workflow_test
A very basic vulcan workflow built for testing and demonstration purposes

The workflow:

- takes in two poems via text-box input
- allows the user to select a counting method via dropdown
- allows the user to select additional arithmetic to perform on the counts
- runs the counting method on both poems, outputting the counts to files
- presents the counts via raw output in the ui
- runs the chosen arithmetic operations and outputs the result to another file
- summarizes everything into a single markdown file
- presents that markdown summary in the ui as another output
